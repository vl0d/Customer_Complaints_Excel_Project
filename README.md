# Consumer Complaints - Excel Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction

Using Excel, I analyzed a U.S. consumer complaints dataset to uncover patterns in complaint volume, issue types, and company responses. The objective was to simulate a real-world business scenario where a **concise, static report** is delivered to decision-makers who need quick, actionable insights.

Unlike exploratory dashboards filled with slicers and filters, this version emphasizes **clarity and focus**, presenting a single, well-supported narrative—ideal for **executive summaries** and stakeholder presentations.

## 📊 Dashboard Walkthrough

### ⏳ Evolution of Complaints by Year

To identify ways to reduce complaint volume, I first visualized the total number of complaints submitted over time.

### 🧭 Complaint Distribution by Product

Using Pivot Tables and bar charts, I analyzed how complaints were distributed across products. The results revealed that just two product categories account for the majority of complaints—indicating areas that need closer attention.

### 🔍 Identifying Key Issues

Focusing on the two most complained-about products, I identified the four most common issues. Addressing these specific issues could significantly reduce the total number of complaints.

### 🚩 Monetary Impact

A large portion of complaints resulted in monetary relief from companies—signaling ongoing financial losses. This insight underlines the importance of proactively addressing recurring problems.

### 🌐 Submission Method Insight

Most complaints were submitted via the **Web**. This suggests that web-based communication channels could be leveraged to proactively educate customers about frequent issues—potentially reducing future complaints.

### 🎯 Why No Slicers or Filters?

The absence of interactivity is **intentional**. This dashboard was designed to simulate a static report or slide deck—something decision-makers can grasp in under a minute. While I’m fully capable of building interactive dashboards, here I prioritized **clarity over complexity**.

## 📊 Estimated Impact

Failing to act on the findings could result in:
- Reduced consumer trust  
- Increased regulatory scrutiny  
- Lost opportunities for service improvement and customer retention  

The dashboard proposes targeting high-volume issues within key product categories to maximize impact.

## ✅ Conclusion

Through this project, I was able to:

- Build a complete Excel pipeline from raw data to insights  
- Apply analytical reasoning to uncover actionable trends  
- Create a visually clear and informative static dashboard  

This project demonstrates how well-used Excel tools can turn real-world, messy data into **clear and strategic business insights**.
